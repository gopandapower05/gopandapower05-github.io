                Rooibos tea is gaining popularity as a delicious and healthy beverage.
                Consumed in southern Africa for centuries, it has become a beloved drink around the world.
                It's a flavorful, caffeine-free alternative to black and green tea.
                What's more, advocates praise rooibos for its potential health benefits, claiming that its antioxidants can protect against cancer, heart disease and stroke.
                However, you may wonder if these benefits are supported by evidence.
                This article explores rooibos teaâ€™s health benefits and potential side effects.
                Rooibos tea is also known as red tea or red bush tea.
                It is made using leaves from a shrub called Aspalathus linearis, usually grown on the western coast of South Africa.
                Rooibos is a herbal tea and is not related to green or black tea.
                Traditional rooibos is created by fermenting the leaves, which turns them a red-brown color.
                Green rooibos, which is not fermented, is also available. It tends to be more expensive and grassier in flavor than the traditional version of the tea, while also boasting more antioxidants.
                Rooibos tea is usually consumed like black tea. Some people add milk and sugar and rooibos iced tea, espressos, lattes and cappuccinos have also taken off.
                Contrary to some claims, rooibos tea is not a good source of vitamins or minerals aside from copper and fluoride.
                However, it is full of powerful antioxidants, which may offer health benefits.
