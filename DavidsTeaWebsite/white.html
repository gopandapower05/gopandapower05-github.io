                White tea is known to be one of the most delicate tea varieties because it is so minimally processed. 
                White tea is harvested before the tea plant’s leaves open fully, when the young buds are still covered by fine white hairs, hence the name “white” tea.
                These buds and unfurled leaves from the newest growth on the tea plant are handpicked and then quickly and meticulously dried, 
                so the leaves are not allowed to oxidize as long as leaves plucked for green or black tea production. 
                This minimal processing and low oxidation results in some of the most delicate and freshest tea available. 
                it’s important to know that all tea—white, green, oolong, black and even pu-erh—comes from the same Camellia sinensis plant, 
                an evergreen bush indigenous to both China and India. 
                Hundreds of cultivars and hybrids have evolved from the Camellia sinensis plant over time,
                 each thriving in diverse geographical areas of the world. 
                 But it’s ultimately the variety of tea plant and how the plant’s leaves are processed that defines the final type of tea that ends up in your teacup.
