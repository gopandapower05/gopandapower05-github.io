                Pu-erh is an aged, fermented tea that comes from the Yunnan province in China. 
                Pu-erh tea is unique because it’s made from a natural fermentation process. 
                This process oxidizes the plant’s leaves, amplifying its antioxidant benefits.
                It also contributes to the tea’s distinct flavor and aroma. 
                Although pu-erh has a robust, earthy base, its profile will develop over time. 
                That means the longer it’s stored, the more flavorful it will taste.
                Pu-erh tea contains antioxidants, which can help prevent damage caused by free radicals. 
                If left unchecked, free radicals can lead to disease and illness. 
                Drink a cup of pu-erh any time you need a little boost.
                The tea’s anti-inflammatory properties may help ease redness, swelling, and other irritation. 
                They may also soothe pain caused by inflammatory conditions, like arthritis.
                You can apply the tea topically to treat inflamed skin, or drink a cup or two to help heal your body from the inside out.
