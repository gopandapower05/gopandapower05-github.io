                Matcha is a type of green tea that is the central focus of Japanese tea ceremonies. It is traditionally 
                prepared using a chasen, or a bamboo whisk, to knead matcha powder into hot water. It takes a lot of practice, 
                precision and dedication to obtain the perfect frothy and creamy mixture.
                Matcha is made from finely ground whole green tea leaves, making it more potent than other brewed teas. 
                When you drink matcha, you get 100% of the nutrients, including vitamins, fiber and 137 times the antioxidants of a cup of regularly brewed green tea.
                One teaspoon of matcha has 70 mg of caffeine, while a shot of espresso contains just 64 mg of caffeine. 
                This means that one cup of matcha tea will give you a greater energy boost than your average cup of Joe
                Studies have shown that regular matcha drinkers have 35-40% higher metabolic rates than those who don’t drink matcha. 
                A higher metabolism means that at resting state, your body uses more calories than a person with slower metabolism. 
                Drinking tea to lose weight? We’ll take that!
