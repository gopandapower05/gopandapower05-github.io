                The new modern language has made it easier for us to code. Examples are
                <br>
                - Clean syntax, which makes code readable and easier to work with
                <br>
                - Optionals, a new way of expressing when a value may not exist
                <br>
                - Type inference, which speeds up development and allows the compiler to help identify common issues
                <br>
                - Type safety, which enforces code that's less likely to crash your program
                <br>
                - Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, which automatically handles some of the
                deeper
                technical challenges of native programming
                <br>
                - Tuples and multiple return values, which allow smaller units of code to do more
                <br>
                - Generics, which help developers write code that can be used in multiple scenarios
                <br>
                - Fast and concise iteration over collections, making Swift a fast language
                <br>
                - Structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols, which allow Swift to optimize for memory use
                and
                speed while providing flexibility for developers
                <br>
                - Map, filter, reduce, and other functional programming patterns, which simplify code and streamline
                common
                actions that previously required multiple lines of code
                <br>
                - Powerful error handling, which helps the developer write fewer bugs and better handle scenarios that
                could cause apps to crash or perform unexpectedly

        <h3>Swift</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>When starting out with a new programming language,build a "Hello, world!" app, the simplest program you
                can write in any language.
                All this program does is print "Hello, world!" to the screen
                Is written in plain text files with a .swift file extension
                Each line represents a statement, and a program is made up of one or more statements
                These are the instructions you wish your app to run
                Works its wah from top to bottom
                Will learn about logic such as if and else
                In Swift the default file is called main.swift
                Any Swift code included in the main.swift file
                Print() is a function that takes a bit of text, called a String, and prints it to the console
                Console is a text-entry and display tool for system administration</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Playground</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>
                For starters, they make writing Swift code fun and simple
                They make it easy to manage more code in one place and to see multiple results in the results sidebar
                Playground is a file wrapper around a main.swift file
                View printed results from your Swift code, you can open a debug console area in a Playground</p>
