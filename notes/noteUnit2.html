                Constants and  associate a name with a value of a particular type.
                Can then use the name to refer to that value many times in program. 
                Once it's set, the value of a constant cannot be changed. 
                But the value of a variable can be changed at any time. 
                Asking it to associate the constant or variable name with the assigned value so the programmer can access the value later.

        <h3>Constant</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>
                Create constant a constant using let name = "whatever"
                Name is constant so you can not give a new value after this
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>
                Use variable when the program has a value that may change during the life time.
                Create a new variable by using var age = "whatever"
            </p>

        <h3>Constant and Variable</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>
               - names can not contain mathematical symbols
               <br>
               - names can not contain space
               <br>
               - names can not begin with a number
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Types</h3>
        <div class="noteContainer">
            <p>
                there are 4 types
                Integer = represents whole numbers or integers
                <br>
                Double = Represents numbers requiring decimal points
                <br>
                Booleon = Represents true of false
                <br> 
                String = Represents text 
                <br>
                Can not mix them up or add them together. 
                IF they are written together, the console will not recognize and will give error
                And always give value for string, double, integer, and booleon.
