        <h2>Crash Course</h2>
        <p>Computers are the lifeblood of today's world. If they were to suddenly turn off all at once, the power grid would
            shut down, cars would crash, planes would fall, water treatment plants would stop, stock markets would freeze,
            trucks with food wouldn't know where to deliver, and employees wouldn't get paid. Computers really has transformed
            nearly every aspect of our lives. This is not the first time we have seen this sort of technology driven global
            change. Advances in manufactuing during the industrial Revolution brought a new scale to human civilization in
            agriculture, industry and domestic life. Mechanization meant superior harvests and more food, mass produced goods,
            cheaper and faster travel and communication, and usually a better qquality of life. Computing technology is doing
            the same right now from automated farming and medical equipment, to global telecommunications and educational
            opportunities, and new frontiers like Virtual Reality and Self Driving Cars. With billions of transistors in
            just your smartphones, computers can seem pretty complicated, but really, they're just simple machines that perform
            complex actions through many layers of abstraction. coding are broke down into layers, built up from simple 1's
            and 0's to logic untis, CPUs, operating systems, the entire internet and beyond.
            <br>The earliest recognized device for computing was the abacus, invented in Mesopotamia around 2500BCE. It is essentially
            a hand operated calculator that jeps add and subtract many numbers. It also stores the current state of the computation
            much like your hard drive does today. The abacus was created because, the scale of society had become greateer
            than waht a single person could keep and manipulate in their mind. there might be thousands of people in a villiage
            of tens of thousands of cattle. There are many variants of the abacus, but let's look at really basic version
            with each row representing a different power of ten. So each bead on the bottom row represents a single unit,
            in the next row they represent. Over the next 4000 years, humans developed all sorts of clever computing devices,
            like the astrolabe, which enabled ships to calculate their latitude at sea. Or the slide rule, for assisting
            with multiplication and division. And there are literally hundred of types of clocks created that could be used
            to calculate sunrise, tides, positions of celestial bodies, and even just the time. Each one of these devices
            made something that was previously laborious to calculate much faster, easier, and often more accurate. It lowered
            the barrier to entry, and at the same time, amplified our mental abilities. As early computer pioneer Charles
            Babbage said, "At each increase of noewledge, as well as on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes
            abridged."
            <br> However, none of these devices were called "computers" The earliest documented use of the word "computer" is
            from 1613m in a book by Richard Braithwait. It wasn't machine at al it was a joke title. Braithwait said, "I
            have read the truest computer of time, and the best arithemetician that eer breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes
            into a short number". In those days, computer was a person who did calculations, sometimes with the help of machines
            but often not.
            <br>The Analytical Engine would inspire, arguabky, the first generation of computer scientists, who incorporated
            many of Babbage's idea in thier machines. In 1890 it would take 13 years to compute. </p>

        <h2>Lesson 3: Images</h2>
        <p>&lt;img&gt;= image body element, defines an image in a HTML page.</p>
        <p>&lt;src&gt;= source attribute, specifies the URL of an image. There are 2 different ways to use this attribute.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>using URL of image: Method #1</li>
            <li>Saving the Image File: Method #2</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>advantage of using the second method is if the image is deleted in the internet, the image won't be displayed.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Height&Width:</b>
        <p> Used to resize the image in pixels. You can specify only one height or width and the aspect ratio will be adjusted.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Lesson 2: Attributes</h2>
        <p>Attribute: Something</p>
        <p>br: Break Row body element, inserts a single line break. Line breaks can be used anywhere inside body.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Comments: Code that is ignored by the computer. Attributes: Proviedes addititonal information about elements.</p>
        <p>Start: A tag can have multiple attributes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Reversed: specifies that the list order should be descending.</p>
